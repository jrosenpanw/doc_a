# latest

Use the latest() function within a comp or windowcomp stage to retrieve the single chronologically latest value for a specified field within each group of rows.

## Syntax

```SQL
comp latest(<field>) [as <alias>] [by <field1>[, <field2>...]] [addrawdata = true|false [as <target field>]]
```

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| field | string, numeric, timestamp | Yes | The field from which you want to retrieve the chronologically latest value. |
| alias | string | No | An optional name for the output column. |
| field1, field2 | string, numeric, boolean | No | Optional fields used to group rows; the latest value is calculated independently for each group. |
| addrawdata | boolean | No | When set to true, includes a column listing the raw events contributing to the aggregate result. |

## Returns

The latest() function returns a single value representing the chronologically latest entry for the specified field within its window or partition.

## Usage Notes

* This function requires the dataset to contain a time-related field (such as _time) to be considered valid for chronological evaluation.

* When used with the comp stage, system fields like _time are removed from the result set unless explicitly included in the by clause.

* The order of selection depends entirely on the chronological order of events.

* If you utilize the addrawdata = true option, the query will process up to 50 defined fields and display up to 100 contributing events.

## Examples

### Example 1: Find the latest event ID across the entire dataset

**Goal**: Identify the ID of the most recent event recorded in the dataset.

**XQL Code**:

```SQL
config timeframe = 1d  
| dataset = sample_xql_raw  
| comp latest(event_id) as latest_event_id
```

**Explanation**: This query scans the sample_xql_raw dataset for the last 24 hours and identifies the event_id of the record with the most recent timestamp.

**Output**:

| LATEST_EVENT_ID |
| :---- |
| 110 |

### Example 2: Find the latest log entry grouped by success status

**Goal**: Retrieve the most recent raw log data separately for successful and unsuccessful events.

**XQL Code**:

```SQL
config timeframe = 1d  
| dataset = sample_xql_raw  
| comp latest(raw_log_data) as latest_raw_log by is_successful
```

**Explanation**: The query partitions the data into groups based on the is_successful status and retrieves the chronologically latest raw_log_data for each group.

**Output**:

| IS_SUCCESSFUL | LATEST_RAW_LOG |
| :---- | :---- |
| true | "Full backup of prod_db to S3 completed." |
| false | "Client C2 hit rate limit on /data endpoint." |
