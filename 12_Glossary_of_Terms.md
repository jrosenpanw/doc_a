# 12. Glossary of Terms

[cite_start]This glossary provides definitions for key terms and acronyms used in Cortex products. [cite: 2539]

* [cite_start]**BIOC (Behavioral Indicators of Compromise)**: Rules that detect malicious behavior by looking at a chain of activities (related to processes, registry, files, network) rather than static indicators like hashes. [cite: 2550, 2551]
* [cite_start]**Broker VM (Broker Virtual Machine)**: A secure virtual machine that bridges your network with Cortex products, enabling secure routing of endpoint traffic and collection of logs. [cite: 2557, 2558]
* [cite_start]**Case (formerly Incident)**: A collection of related security alerts and data that tells the full contextual story of a security problem, streamlining investigation. [cite: 2565]
* [cite_start]**CGO (Causality Group Owner)**: The root process that is responsible for an entire chain of events and alerts displayed in the Causality View. [cite: 2568, 2569]
* **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)**: A cybersecurity approach that relies on endpoint data to detect and respond to threats. [cite_start]Cortex XDR expands on this by incorporating data from network, cloud, and other sources. [cite: 2598, 2600]
* [cite_start]**IOC (Indicators of Compromise)**: Traditional indicators of a breach, such as malicious file hashes, IP addresses, or domain names. [cite: 2640, 2641]
* [cite_start]**Issue (formerly Alert)**: An event or finding that identifies a problem in your environment that crosses a defined risk threshold and requires attention. [cite: 2643, 2644]
* [cite_start]**Playbook**: An automated workflow that orchestrates a series of tasks, commands, and conditions to respond to security events, improving efficiency. [cite: 2676, 2677]
* [cite_start]**SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)**: A capability that automates security use cases through the use of integrations and playbooks. [cite: 2688]
* [cite_start]**XDM (Cortex Data Model)**: A unified data model that maps logs from various sources into a single, consolidated schema, simplifying data interaction and queries. [cite: 2583, 2584]
* [cite_start]**XDR (Extended Detection and Response)**: An advanced approach to threat detection that gathers and analyzes telemetry from multiple sources—including endpoint, network, and cloud—to provide greater accuracy and coverage than traditional EDR. [cite: 2619]
* [cite_start]**XQL (Cortex Query Language)**: A powerful query language used to search and analyze data from the wide variety of sources ingested into Cortex XSIAM. [cite: 2587]
