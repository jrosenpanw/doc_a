managing content packs in Marketplace when defining/editing user roles.

In Marketplace, you can browse all content packs (including installed
content) or view only installed content packs.

You can search for content packs by entering text in the search bar and
selecting the relevant content pack from the search results.

You can sort content packs by latest update, best match, recommended,
number of downloads, and filter according to the following criteria:

- **Use cases:** Filter according to high-level use cases, such as
  Phishing, Malware, Ransomware, and Access.

- **Integrations:** Filter according to the integration included in the
  content pack.

- **Categories:** Filter according to content pack categories, such as
  Messaging, and Forensics & Malware Analysis

### Cortex XSIAM content

In Cortex XSIAM, content includes individual content entities that you
create such as individual playbooks and issue fields, preinstalled
content packs, and content packs that you download from Marketplace.

Content in Marketplace is organized into content packs to support
specific security orchestration use cases. Content packs are created by
Palo Alto Networks, technology partners, contributors, and customers.

You can view Marketplace content packs from within Cortex XSIAM or at
<https://cortex.marketplace.pan.dev/marketplace/>.

In Cortex XSIAM, content includes the following:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Content                           | Description                       |
+===================================+===================================+
| Issue types and fields            | All issues that are ingested into |
|                                   | Cortex XSIAM are assigned an      |
|                                   | issue type when they are          |
|                                   | classified. After you classify    |
|                                   | the issue, you can then map the   |
|                                   | relevant fields to the issue.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Issue types contain fields that   |
|                                   | are relevant to the issue type.   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Classifiers                       | Classification determines the     |
|                                   | type of issue/indicator that is   |
|                                   | created for events ingested from  |
|                                   | a specific integration. You       |
|                                   | create a classifier and define    |
|                                   | that classifier in an             |
|                                   | integration. Mappers map the      |
|                                   | fields from your third-party      |
|                                   | integration to the fields in your |
|                                   | issue/indicator layouts.          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Correlation Rules                 | Analyzes correlation of           |
|                                   | multi-event from multiple sources |
|                                   | by using the Cortex XSIAM         |
|                                   | XQL-based engine for creating     |
|                                   | these correlations (scheduled)    |
|                                   | rules. Issues can then be         |
|                                   | triggered based on these rules    |
|                                   | with a defined time frame and     |
|                                   | schedule.                         |

|                                   | customizable widgets, which       |
|                                   | enables you to analyze data from  |
|                                   | inside or outside Cortex XSIAM,   |
|                                   | in different formats such as line |
|                                   | charts, tables, text, etc.        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Data Model Rules                  | Data Model rules enable you to    |
|                                   | normalize logs for out-of-the-box |
|                                   | analytics and data enrichment.    |

### Manage content packs

You can install, delete, update, and revert content packs. Before you
install a content pack, you should review the content pack to see what
it includes and the various dependencies. The following is the
information you can view:

- **Details:** General information about the content pack such as
  installation, content, version, author, and status.

- **Content:** The content to be installed, such as scripts or
  integrations.

- **Dependencies:** Details of any required content packs and optional
  content packs that may need to be installed with your content pack.

- **Version History:** View the currently installed version, earlier
  versions, available updates, and revert if required.

**Dependencies**

In Cortex XSIAM content packs, some objects are dependent on other
objects. For example, an issue may be dependent on a playbook, an issue
type, and an issue field. A script may be dependent on another script,
or an integration. When you place a content pack in your cart, mandatory
dependencies including  required content packs are added automatically
to ensure that the content pack installs correctly.

Optional content packs are used by the content pack you want to install,
but are not necessary for installation. When you place a content pack in
your cart, you can choose which optional content pack to install. When
you install optional content packs, mandatory dependencies in the
optional content pack are automatically included.

> **Note**
>
> Optional content packs that are already installed are treated like
> they are required content packs to preserve content integrity.

Install a content pack

You can only install one content pack at a time. Cortex
XSIAM automatically adds any content that is required to install the
content pack. You can also add any optional content packs that use the
content pack you want to install.

If you receive an error message when you try to install a content pack,
you need to fix the error before installing. If a warning message is
issued, you can still download the content pack, but you should fix the
problem; otherwise, the content may not work correctly.

1.  Go to Marketplace \> Browse and locate the content pack you want to
    install.

2.  Click the required content pack and review the contents.

3.  Click **Install** to add the content pack to the **Cart**.

4.  (*Optional*) If the content pack includes optional content, select
    the content packs you want to add.

- The **Cart** displays the number of items you are installing,
  including any required content packs. You can log in and out, but the
  content packs remain in the **Cart** until you click either
  **Empty cart** or **Install**.

5.  Click **Install**.

6.  After installation, click **Refresh content**.

> **Note**
>
> In addition to content packs that you install from Marketplace,
> related content packs are automatically downloaded when you adopt
> playbooks or edit tasks that require content items such as scripts or
> integrations.

Delete a content pack

When you delete a content pack, all content is deleted, including all
detached and customized content.

> **Caution**
>
> If another content pack is dependent on the content pack you want to
> delete, it may break the other content pack. You can reinstall the
> content pack, but you cannot restore detached and customized content.

1.  Go to Marketplace \> Installed Content Packs.

2.  In the **Content Packs Library** section, search for the content
    pack and select the content pack you want to delete.

3.  Click the trash can icon.

4.  Review the warning message and click **Delete**.

Update a content pack

Content packs are updated for bug fixes, enhancements, and more.
Marketplace is updated every 2 hours and when there is an update
available for a content pack, you will see a notification in
the **Installed Content Packs** tab in Marketplace.

In the **Version History** tab of a content pack, you can see the
currently installed version, earlier versions, and available updates.
You can revert to a previous version of a content pack if required.

All dependent content packs update automatically with the content pack.

> **Note**
>
> Third-party product Integrations are developed and tested against a
> specific product version. For products that are on-prem or cloud-based
> with specific API versions, the version developed and tested against
> will be included in the integration\'s documentation. Newer versions
> of the product are not always immediately tested, and it is expected
> that products maintain API compatibility upon release of newer product
> versions. When upgrading to a newer product version, it is highly
> recommended to test the integration in a dev environment before
> deploying to production.
>
> **Caution**
>
> If you want to downgrade, any content that depends on the content pack
> including any customizations may be deleted if it does not exist in
> the target content pack version.

1.  In the **Show** field of the **Installed Content Packs** tab, select
    **Update available** to display the content packs that are available
    to update.

2.  Click the content pack you want to update.

3.  In the **Version History** tab of the content pack, view the
    available updates.

4.  Click **Update**. If there is more than one update available, click
    the version to update.

- If you choose to install the latest version it includes the previous
  version. If you have made any customizations these are included in any
  update. If any dependencies require updating, these are automatically
  added.

5.  Click **Install**.

6.  After the content pack installs, click **Refresh content**.

Revert a content pack

You can revert to an earlier version of an installed content pack. Items
that are not included in the version are also deleted, such as detached
playbooks or scripts that use other scripts from the content pack. This
may cause other content packs to stop working

1.  In the **Installed Content Packs** tab, click the content pack you
    want to revert.

2.  In the **Version History** tab, select the version to which you want
    to revert.

3.  Click **Revert to this version**. The version will be added to your
    **Cart**.

4.  In the **Cart**, click **Downgrade**.

### Marketplace FAQs

**Should Marketplace content always be updated?**

Marketplace updates are a source for bug fixes and provide new commands
for integrations and scripts. It's best practice to update content packs
to the newest available version. If you encounter any issue with content
updates, you can revert to a previous version with one click.

**When can Marketplace content be updated?**

You can update content while the system is in use. If a playbook, for
example, is running on an issue while you update that playbook, the
original version of the playbook will continue to run without a problem.
If the playbook includes an integration command that has been updated,
and the update occurs before the playbook reaches this task, the new
version of the integration command will be used.

**When should content items be duplicated versus detached?**

To edit a content item, the item must be detached or custom content.
When content items are detached, they do not receive updates from
Marketplace. There are two options for editing content items:

- Detach content items (such as playbooks and automations) and edit the
  content items. If you want to receive content updates in the future,
  you can reattach the content item, but the modifications you made
  while the item was detached will be overwritten with the content
  update.

- Duplicate the content item and edit the copy. When a content item is
  duplicate,d it becomes a custom content item, and therefore will not
  receive updates, but you can view updates to the original content
  item.

**How does Marketplace content differ from custom content?**

After Marketplace content is installed you can detach or duplicate the
content and customize the content as needed. Custom content is, by
definition, detached and does not receive updates.

**How can content updates be rolled back? Are dependencies automatically rolled back as well?**

You can view all versions of a content pack in Marketplace and revert to
earlier versions there. When you revert a content pack, only the content
pack is reverted, not the pack dependencies.

### Content pack contributions

Contributions are content packs that you create for Marketplace, which
are submitted to the Cortex XSIAM content development team for review
and approval. After approval, these content packs are uploaded to
Marketplace, and are shared and installed like any other content pack.
When creating new content you want to share, such as playbooks, scripts,
issue types, and integrations, or when updating content, you can create
a [GitHub pull
request](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/contributing/contributing#before-opening-a-pull-request) to
the public content repository, to submit your content for review.

**Review process**

The review process consists of the Cortex XSIAM team checking that your
contribution meets code, documentation, naming, and other standards. You
receive a form to complete asking for more information, such as
certification, contact details, etc. The Cortex XSIAM team will be in
touch with you during the review process.

During the review process, you may be asked to make changes in the code,
or for more data, metadata, dependencies, documentation, support, and
certification model, etc. You can anonymize your name if required.

When your contribution is approved, it is uploaded to **Marketplace**
where other Cortex XSIAM users can view, download, and rate it. We
encourage you to learn more about the [contribution
process](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/contributing/contributing).
