## Cortex XSIAM 3.x Documentation

Using the Cortex XSIAM APIs, you can integrate Cortex XSIAM with
third-party apps or services to ingest alerts and to leverage alert
stitching and investigation capabilities. The APIs allows you to manage
incidents in a ticketing or automation system of your choice by
reviewing and editing the incident\'s details, status, and assignee.
Using the APIs, you can also retrieve information on the endpoints,
create installation package, perform response actions directly on the
endpoint and more.
