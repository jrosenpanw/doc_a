## Security Operations Center roles and responsibilities

### What is the role of a Security Operations Center?

Security Operations Centers (SOC) were created to facilitate
collaboration among security personnel, with a primary focus on security
monitoring and alerting, including the collection and analysis of data
to identify suspicious activity and improve the organization\'s
security. A SOC can streamline the security incident handling process as
well as help analysts triage and resolve security incidents more
efficiently and effectively. In today's digital world, a SOC can be
located in-house, in the cloud (virtual SOC), staffed internally,
outsourced, for example, to an MSSP or MDR, or a mix of these. SOCs can
provide continuous protection with uninterrupted monitoring and
visibility into critical assets across the attack surface. They can
provide a fast and effective response, decreasing the time elapsed
between when the compromise first occurred and the mean time to
detection.

### Roles and responsibilities

Typical core roles that make up a SOC team consist of different tiers of
SOC analysts and dedicated managers:

- **Tier 1 ‑ Triage specialist:** Mainly responsible for collecting raw
  data as well as reviewing alarms and alerts. They need to confirm,
  determine, or adjust the criticality of alerts and enrich them with
  relevant data. For every alert, the triage specialist has to identify
  whether it's justified or a false positive, as alert fatigue is a real
  issue. An additional responsibility at this level is identifying other
  high-risk events and potential incidents. All these need to be
  prioritized according to their criticality. If problems occurring
  cannot be solved at this level, they have to be escalated to tier 2
  analysts. Furthermore, triage specialists are often managing and
  configuring the monitoring tools.

- **Tier 2 ‑ Incident responder:** Reviews the higher-priority security
  incidents escalated by triage specialists and does a more in-depth
  assessment using threat intelligence, such as indicators of compromise
  and updated rules. Incident responders need to understand the scope of
  an attack and be aware of the affected systems. The raw attack
  telemetry data collected at tier 1 is transformed into actionable
  threat intelligence at this second tier. Incident responders are
  responsible for designing and implementing strategies to contain and
  recover from an incident. If a tier 2 analyst faces major issues with
  identifying or mitigating an attack, additional tier 2 analysts are
  consulted, or the incident is escalated to tier 3.

- **Tier 3 ‑ Threat hunter:** Most experienced workforce in a SOC.
  Threat hunters handle major incidents escalated to them by the
  incident responders. They also perform or at least supervise
  vulnerability assessments and penetration tests to identify possible
  attack vectors. Their most important responsibility is to proactively
  identify possible threats, security gaps, and vulnerabilities that
  might be unknown. They should also recommend ways to optimize the
  deployed security monitoring tools as they gain reasonable knowledge
  about a possible threat to the systems. Additionally, any critical
  security alerts, threat intelligence, and other security data provided
  by tier 1 and tier 2 analysts need to be reviewed at this tier.

- **SOC manager:** Supervises the security operations team. SOC managers
  provide technical guidance if needed, but most importantly, they are
  in charge of adequately managing the team. This includes hiring,
  training, and evaluating team members; creating processes; assessing
  incident reports; and developing and implementing necessary crisis
  communication plans. They also oversee the financial aspects of a SOC,
  support security audits, and report to the chief information security
  officer (CISO) or a respective top-level management position.
