## Widgets

Widgets are the individual components that make up a dashboard. [cite_start]They can display data in various formats like graphs, pie charts, tables, and text. [cite: 2527] [cite_start]The **Widget Library** contains a collection of predefined widgets and allows you to create your own custom widgets to visualize data from Cortex XSIAM or external sources.
