# 1. Plan and Prepare Your Cortex XSIAM Deployment

Before you begin the deployment process, it's crucial to plan and prepare. This involves understanding your storage and bandwidth needs, determining the hosting region, and familiarizing yourself with the overall onboarding process.

## Prepare for Deployment

Consider the following key aspects before you start:

* **Log Storage**: Determine the amount of log storage your deployment will require. You may need to consult with your partner or sales representative to purchase additional storage for your Cortex XSIAM tenant.
* **Hosting Region**: Decide on the geographic region where you want to host your Cortex XSIAM tenant and any related services. If you plan to stream data from a Strata Logging Service, it must be in the same region as your XSIAM instance. A list of supported regions is available in the documentation.
* **Bandwidth Requirements**: If you are using a Cortex XDR Pro per Endpoint license, you must calculate the necessary bandwidth to support your agents. The general requirement is **1.2Mbps of bandwidth for every 1,000 agents**. This scales proportionally; for example, 100,000 agents would require 120Mbps of bandwidth.

## Cortex XSIAM Onboarding Checklist

The onboarding process follows a structured checklist to ensure a successful deployment. The recommended steps are:

1.  **Activate Cortex XSIAM**: The initial step to get your tenant up and running.
2.  **Pre-installation steps for Cortex XDR agents**: Prepare your environment for agent deployment.
3.  **Install Cortex XDR agents**: Roll out the agents to your endpoints.
4.  **Configure and deploy**: Set up the core components of Cortex XSIAM.
5.  **Define data sources**: Integrate various data sources for comprehensive analytics.
6.  **Perform health checks**: Verify that the system is operating correctly post-deployment.
